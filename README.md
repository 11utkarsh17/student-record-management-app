# 🎓 Student Record Management System (Java Console App)

This is a simple **Java-based console application** that allows you to manage student records. It supports basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and is ideal for learning purposes or mini-projects.

## 📌 Features

- ➕ Add a new student
- 📋 View all students
- 🔍 Search a student by roll number
- ✏️ Update student information
- 🗑️ Delete a student record
- 🚪 Exit the application

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **Java**
- **Scanner class** (for console input)
- OOP Concepts (Classes, Objects, Methods)

---

## 🧩 How It Works

The main file (`Main.java`) presents a **menu-driven interface** where the user can interact with the system using numbered options.

The logic for managing student data (like storing, updating, deleting) is handled by a separate class named `StudentManager` which uses a collection (like ArrayList or HashMap) to store students.
